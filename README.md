About me:
  I have a burning passion for learning new technology & ways to improve life with technology. I have a huge focus in Cyber Security & Programming but still hugely intrigued in everything else such as hardware, networking, cryptocurrency, etc.  When something blows my mind I take it upon myself to learn everything about it & become a part of the experience. If Iâ€™m not learning new tech & programming then Iâ€™m gaming. I give 150% towards anything I work on. A big example of this would be during my Programming Career Tech in high school Junior/Senior year my grade pretty much was based off of how well I helped my peers learn & my competitions & not the class itself since Iâ€™ve been self-taught since 8 years old. I did competitions for BPA(Business Professionals of America) for Computer Animation Team with my best friend Joey. I'm a very outgoing & optimistic techie.
  
  
Competitions:
  Junior year I wasn't motivated for anything in school. I wanted to only program & dreaded going. Until one day sitting next to my friend Joey we had to choose an event to compete in for BPA as a grade requirement for Programming Career Tech. We were wondering what to do. We almost settled on Video Production until a Senior came into the class bragging about how since he got 13th last year at nationals he had no competition & was going to dominate the competition. Joey & I then decided we wanted to challenge that. We have never touched 3D modeling or animation in our lives(We didn't even know what software to even use). We were determined at that point to win though so after countless nights staying at school & coming in on the weekend we lost to the senior team at regionals. They got 1st and we got 2nd. This didn't discourage us though... only made us work harder. We beat the seniors at states where we got 2nd & they got 3rd. Only 1st & 2nd gets to go to nationals although there was a technical issue with providing our school the scores of all the competitors so they in turn let the seniors go as well. The seniors then at nationals after they poured their hearts out got 12th. We also poured our hearts out in this friendly competition & got 7th. 
  
  Senior year we didn't have local competition but we still had our eyes set on one goal: 1st place nationals. So we pour the same dedication to this year making a new animation doing things that we have never seen anyone do with both their animations & presentations. It was risky but definitely worked out very well. We didn't go for your typical stuff such as making fake brand names for realism, bullet point presentation, 100% hand animated. I decided to make presentations with more flash and less words/bullets. That we would play off each otherâ€™s sentences and speak truly from the heart about the journey and the project. I also after a lot of time finally convinced the school to buy motion capture suits & used them for more fluid animations. I was so confident in our presentation/animation that we happily presented to executives at the company Owens Corning. This journey paid off when we got 1st at regionals 1st at states and 2nd at nationals
  
  Some mentions are I got 4th in cyber security Junior year but didn't pursue it because I was to focused on animation and you can only choose one event to proceed to the state level if you qualify for multiple events. I also got 1st place leading the Administrative support team at regionals but handed my position over for the same reason as cyber security
